25.3.	Timer 3
Timer 3 is a 16-bit timer formed by two 8-bit SFRs: TMR3L (low byte) and TMR3H (high byte). Timer 3 may operate in 16-bit auto-reload mode or (split) 8-bit auto-reload mode. The T3SPLIT bit (TMR2CN.3) defines the Timer 3 operation mode. Timer 3 can also be used in Capture Mode to measure the external oscillator source or the Comparator 1 period with respect to another oscillator. The ability to measure the Comparator 1 period with respect to the system clock is makes using Touch Sense Switches very easy.
Timer 3 may be clocked by the system clock, the system clock divided by 12, external oscillator source divided by 8, or Comparator 1 output. The external oscillator source divided by 8 and Comparator 1 output is synchronized with the system clock.
25.3.1.	16-bit Timer with Auto-Reload
When T3SPLIT (TMR3CN.3) is zero, Timer 3 operates as a 16-bit timer with auto-reload. Timer 3 can be clocked by SYSCLK, SYSCLK divided by 12, external oscillator clock source divided by 8, or Comparator 1 output. As the 16-bit timer register increments and overflows from 0xFFFF to 0x0000, the 16-bit value in the Timer 3 reload registers (TMR3RLH and TMR3RLL) is loaded into the Timer 3 register as shown in Figure 25.7, and the Timer 3 High Byte Overflow Flag (TMR3CN.7) is set. If Timer 3 interrupts are enabled (if EIE1.7 is set), an interrupt will be generated on each Timer 3 overflow. Additionally, if Timer 3 interrupts are enabled and the TF3LEN bit is set (TMR3CN.5), an interrupt will be generated each time the lower 8 bits (TMR3L) overflow from 0xFF to 0x00.

25.3.2.	8-bit Timers with Auto-Reload
When T3SPLIT is set, Timer 3 operates as two 8-bit timers (TMR3H and TMR3L). Both 8-bit timers operate in auto-reload mode as shown in Figure 25.8. TMR3RLL holds the reload value for TMR3L; TMR3RLH holds the reload value for TMR3H. The TR3 bit in TMR3CN handles the run control for TMR3H. TMR3L is always running when configured for 8-bit Mode.
Each 8-bit timer may be configured to use SYSCLK, SYSCLK divided by 12, the external oscillator clock source divided by 8, or Comparator 1. The Timer 3 Clock Select bits (T3MH and T3ML in CKCON) select either SYSCLK or the clock defined by the Timer 3 External Clock Select bits (T3XCLK[1:0] in TMR3CN), as follows:
T3MH	T3XCLK[1:0]	TMR3H Clock Source		T3ML	T3XCLK[1:0]	TMR3L Clock Source
0	00	SYSCLK / 12		0	00	SYSCLK / 12
0	01	External Clock / 8		0	01	External Clock / 8
0	10	SYSCLK / 12		0	10	SYSCLK / 12
0	11	Comparator 1		0	11	Comparator 1
1	X	SYSCLK		1	X	SYSCLK

The TF3H bit is set when TMR3H overflows from 0xFF to 0x00; the TF3L bit is set when TMR3L overflows from 0xFF to 0x00. When Timer 3 interrupts are enabled, an interrupt is generated each time TMR3H overflows. If Timer 3 interrupts are enabled and TF3LEN (TMR3CN.5) is set, an interrupt is generated each time either TMR3L or TMR3H overflows. When TF3LEN is enabled, software must check the TF3H and TF3L flags to determine the source of the Timer 3 interrupt. The TF3H and TF3L interrupt flags are not cleared by hardware and must be manually cleared by software.

25.3.3.	Comparator 1/External Oscillator Capture Mode
The Capture Mode in Timer 3 allows either Comparator 1 or the external oscillator period to be measured against the system clock or the system clock divided by 12. Comparator 1 and the external oscillator period can also be compared against each other. 
Setting TF3CEN to 1 enables the Comparator 1/External Oscillator Capture Mode for Timer 3. In this mode, T3SPLIT should be set to 0, as the full 16-bit timer is used. 
When Capture Mode is enabled, a capture event will be generated either every Comparator 1 rising edge or every 8 external clock cycles, depending on the T3XCLK1 setting. When the capture event occurs, the contents of Timer 3 (TMR3H:TMR3L) are loaded into the Timer 3 reload registers (TMR3RLH:TMR3RLL) and the TF3H flag is set (triggering an interrupt if Timer 3 interrupts are enabled). By recording the difference between two successive timer capture values, the Comparator 1 or external clock period can be determined with respect to the Timer 3 clock. The Timer 3 clock should be much faster than the capture clock to achieve an accurate reading. 
For example, if T3ML = 1b, T3XCLK1 = 0b, and TF3CEN = 1b, Timer 3 will clock every SYSCLK and capture every Comparator 1 rising edge. If SYSCLK is 24.5 MHz and the difference between two successive captures is 350 counts, then the Comparator 1 period is:
350 x (1 / 24.5 MHz) = 14.2 µs.
This mode allows software to determine the exact frequency of the external oscillator in C and RC mode or the time between consecutive Comparator 0 rising edges, which is useful for detecting changes in the capacitance of a Touch Sense Switch.

7	TF3H	Timer 3 High Byte Overflow Flag.
Set by hardware when the Timer 3 high byte overflows from 0xFF to 0x00. In 16 bit mode, this will occur when Timer 3 overflows from 0xFFFF to 0x0000. When the Timer 3 interrupt is enabled, setting this bit causes the CPU to vector to the Timer 3 interrupt service routine. This bit is not automatically cleared by hardware.		
6	TF3L	Timer 3 Low Byte Overflow Flag.
Set by hardware when the Timer 3 low byte overflows from 0xFF to 0x00. TF3L will be set when the low byte overflows regardless of the Timer 3 mode. This bit is not automatically cleared by hardware.		
5	TF3LEN	Timer 3 Low Byte Interrupt Enable.
When set to 1, this bit enables Timer 3 Low Byte interrupts. If Timer 3 interrupts are also enabled, an interrupt will be generated when the low byte of Timer 3 overflows.		
4	TF3CEN	Timer 3 Comparator 1/External Oscillator Capture Enable.
When set to 1, this bit enables Timer 3 Capture Mode. 		
3	T3SPLIT	Timer 3 Split Mode Enable.
When this bit is set, Timer 3 operates as two 8-bit timers with auto-reload.
0: Timer 3 operates in 16-bit auto-reload mode.
1: Timer 3 operates as two 8-bit auto-reload timers.		
2	TR3	Timer 3 Run Control. 
Timer 3 is enabled by setting this bit to 1. In 8-bit mode, this bit enables/disables TMR3H only; TMR3L is always enabled in split mode.		
1:0	T3XCLK[1:0]	Timer 3 External Clock Select.
This bit selects the “external” and “capture trigger” clock sources for Timer 3. If Timer 3 is in 8-bit mode, this bit selects the “external” clock source for both timer bytes. Timer 3 Clock Select bits (T3MH and T3ML in register CKCON) may still be used to select between the “external” clock and the system clock for either timer.
Note: External clock sources are synchronized with the system clock.
00: External Clock is SYSCLK /12. Capture trigger is Comparator 1.
01: External Clock is External Oscillator/8. Capture trigger is Comparator 1.
10: External Clock is SYSCLK/12. Capture trigger is External Oscillator/8.
11: External Clock is Comparator 1. Capture trigger is External Oscillator/8.
