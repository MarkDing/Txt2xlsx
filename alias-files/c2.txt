27.	C2 Interface
C8051F93x-C8051F92x devices include an on-chip Silicon Labs 2-Wire (C2) debug interface to allow Flash programming and in-system debugging with the production part installed in the end application. The C2 interface uses a clock signal (C2CK) and a bi-directional C2 data signal (C2D) to transfer information between the device and a host system. See the C2 Interface Specification for details on the C2 protocol.
27.1.	C2 Interface Registers
The following describes the C2 registers necessary to perform Flash programming through the C2 interface. All C2 registers are accessed through the C2 interface as described in the C2 Interface Specification.

SFR Definition 27.1. C2ADD: C2 Address
Bit	7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0

SFR Definition 27.4. FPCTL: C2 Flash Programming Control
Bit	7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0
Name	FPCTL[7:0]							
Type	R/W							
Reset	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

C2 Address: 0x02

7:0	FPCTL[7:0]	Flash Programming Control Register.
This register is used to enable Flash programming via the C2 interface. To enable C2 Flash programming, the following codes must be written in order: 0x02, 0x01. Note that once C2 Flash programming is enabled, a system reset must be issued to resume normal operation.		


SFR Definition 27.5. FPDAT: C2 Flash Programming Data
Bit	7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0
Name	FPDAT[7:0]							
Type	R/W							
Reset	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

C2 Address: 0xB4
Bit	Name	Function		
7:0	FPDAT[7:0]	C2 Flash Programming Data Register.
This register is used to pass Flash commands, addresses, and data during C2 Flash accesses. Valid commands are listed below.		
		Code	Command	
		0x06	Flash Block Read	
		0x07	Flash Block Write	
		0x08	Flash Page Erase	
		0x03	Device Erase	


27.2.	C2 Pin Sharing
The C2 protocol allows the C2 pins to be shared with user functions so that in-system debugging and Flash programming may be performed. This is possible because C2 communication is typically performed when the device is in the halt state, where all on-chip peripherals and user software are stalled. In this halted state, the C2 interface can safely ‘borrow’ the C2CK (RST) and C2D pins. In most applications, external resistors are required to isolate C2 interface traffic from the user application. A typical isolation configuration is shown in Figure 27.1.

Figure 27.1. Typical C2 Pin Sharing
The configuration in Figure 27.1 assumes the following:
	1.	The user input (b) cannot change state while the target device is halted.
	2.	The RST pin on the target device is used as an input only.

Additional resistors may be necessary depending on the specific application.
