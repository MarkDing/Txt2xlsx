24. 	 Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI0)
The Enhanced Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI0) provides access to a flexible, full-duplex synchronous serial bus. SPI0 can operate as a master or slave device in both 3-wire or 4-wire modes, and supports multiple masters and slaves on a single SPI bus. The slave-select (NSS) signal can be configured as an input to select SPI0 in slave mode, or to disable Master Mode operation in a multi-master environment, avoiding contention on the SPI bus when more than one master attempts simultaneous data transfers. NSS can also be configured as a chip-select output in master mode, or disabled for 3-wire operation. Additional general purpose port I/O pins can be used to select multiple slave devices in master mode.

Figure 24.1. SPI Block Diagram
24.1. 	 Signal Descriptions
The four signals used by SPI0 (MOSI, MISO, SCK, NSS) are described below. 
24.1.1.	 Master Out, Slave In (MOSI)
The master-out, slave-in (MOSI) signal is an output from a master device and an input to slave devices. It is used to serially transfer data from the master to the slave. This signal is an output when SPI0 is operating as a master and an input when SPI0 is operating as a slave. Data is transferred most-significant bit first. When configured as a master, MOSI is driven by the MSB of the shift register in both 3- and 4-wire mode.
24.1.2.	 Master In, Slave Out (MISO)
The master-in, slave-out (MISO) signal is an output from a slave device and an input to the master device. It is used to serially transfer data from the slave to the master. This signal is an input when SPI0 is operating as a master and an output when SPI0 is operating as a slave. Data is transferred most-significant bit first. The MISO pin is placed in a high-impedance state when the SPI module is disabled and when the SPI operates in 4-wire mode as a slave that is not selected. When acting as a slave in 3-wire mode, MISO is always driven by the MSB of the shift register.
24.1.3.	 Serial Clock (SCK)
The serial clock (SCK) signal is an output from the master device and an input to slave devices. It is used to synchronize the transfer of data between the master and slave on the MOSI and MISO lines. SPI0 generates this signal when operating as a master. The SCK signal is ignored by a SPI slave when the slave is not selected (NSS = 1) in 4-wire slave mode.
24.1.4.	 Slave Select (NSS)
The function of the slave-select (NSS) signal is dependent on the setting of the NSSMD1 and NSSMD0 bits in the SPI0CN register. There are three possible modes that can be selected with these bits:
1.	NSSMD[1:0] = 00: 3-Wire Master or 3-Wire Slave Mode: SPI0 operates in 3-wire mode, and NSS is disabled. When operating as a slave device, SPI0 is always selected in 3-wire mode. Since no select signal is present, SPI0 must be the only slave on the bus in 3-wire mode. This is intended for point-to-point communication between a master and one slave.
2.	NSSMD[1:0] = 01: 4-Wire Slave or Multi-Master Mode: SPI0 operates in 4-wire mode, and NSS is enabled as an input. When operating as a slave, NSS selects the SPI0 device. When operating as a master, a 1-to-0 transition of the NSS signal disables the master function of SPI0 so that multiple master devices can be used on the same SPI bus.
3.	NSSMD[1:0] = 1x: 4-Wire Master Mode: SPI0 operates in 4-wire mode, and NSS is enabled as an output. The setting of NSSMD0 determines what logic level the NSS pin will output. This configuration should only be used when operating SPI0 as a master device.
See Figure 24.2, Figure 24.3, and Figure 24.4 for typical connection diagrams of the various operational modes. Note that the setting of NSSMD bits affects the pinout of the device. When in 3-wire master or 3-wire slave mode, the NSS pin will not be mapped by the crossbar. In all other modes, the NSS signal will be mapped to a pin on the device. See Section “19. Port Input/Output” on page 153 for general purpose port I/O and crossbar information.
24.2. 	 SPI0 Master Mode Operation
A SPI master device initiates all data transfers on a SPI bus. SPI0 is placed in master mode by setting the Master Enable flag (MSTEN, SPI0CN.6). Writing a byte of data to the SPI0 data register (SPI0DAT) when in master mode writes to the transmit buffer. If the SPI shift register is empty, the byte in the transmit buffer is moved to the shift register, and a data transfer begins. The SPI0 master immediately shifts out the data serially on the MOSI line while providing the serial clock on SCK. The SPIF (SPI0CN.7) flag is set to logic 1 at the end of the transfer. If interrupts are enabled, an interrupt request is generated when the SPIF flag is set. While the SPI0 master transfers data to a slave on the MOSI line, the addressed SPI slave device simultaneously transfers the contents of its shift register to the SPI master on the MISO line in a full-duplex operation. Therefore, the SPIF flag serves as both a transmit-complete and receive-data-ready flag. The data byte received from the slave is transferred MSB-first into the master's shift register. When a byte is fully shifted into the register, it is moved to the receive buffer where it can be read by the processor by reading SPI0DAT. 
When configured as a master, SPI0 can operate in one of three different modes: multi-master mode, 3-wire single-master mode, and 4-wire single-master mode. The default, multi-master mode is active when NSSMD1 (SPI0CN.3) = 0 and NSSMD0 (SPI0CN.2) = 1. In this mode, NSS is an input to the device, and is used to disable the master SPI0 when another master is accessing the bus. When NSS is pulled low in this mode, MSTEN (SPI0CN.6) and SPIEN (SPI0CN.0) are set to 0 to disable the SPI master device, and a Mode Fault is generated (MODF, SPI0CN.5 = 1). Mode Fault will generate an interrupt if enabled. SPI0 must be manually re-enabled in software under these circumstances. In multi-master systems, devices will typically default to being slave devices while they are not acting as the system master device. In multi-master mode, slave devices can be addressed individually (if needed) using general-purpose I/O pins. Figure 24.2 shows a connection diagram between two master devices in multiple-master mode.
3-wire single-master mode is active when NSSMD1 (SPI0CN.3) = 0 and NSSMD0 (SPI0CN.2) = 0. In this mode, NSS is not used, and is not mapped to an external port pin through the crossbar. Any slave devices that must be addressed in this mode should be selected using general-purpose I/O pins. Figure 24.3 shows a connection diagram between a master device in 3-wire master mode and a slave device.
4-wire single-master mode is active when NSSMD1 (SPI0CN.3) = 1. In this mode, NSS is configured as an output pin, and can be used as a slave-select signal for a single SPI device. In this mode, the output value of NSS is controlled (in software) with the bit NSSMD0 (SPI0CN.2). Additional slave devices can be addressed using general-purpose I/O pins. Figure 24.4 shows a connection diagram for a master device in 4-wire master mode and two slave devices.

24.3. 	 SPI0 Slave Mode Operation
When SPI0 is enabled and not configured as a master, it will operate as a SPI slave. As a slave, bytes are shifted in through the MOSI pin and out through the MISO pin by a master device controlling the SCK signal. A bit counter in the SPI0 logic counts SCK edges. When 8 bits have been shifted through the shift register, the SPIF flag is set to logic 1, and the byte is copied into the receive buffer. Data is read from the receive buffer by reading SPI0DAT. A slave device cannot initiate transfers. Data to be transferred to the master device is pre-loaded into the shift register by writing to SPI0DAT. Writes to SPI0DAT are double-buffered, and are placed in the transmit buffer first. If the shift register is empty, the contents of the transmit buffer will immediately be transferred into the shift register. When the shift register already contains data, the SPI will load the shift register with the transmit buffer’s contents after the last SCK edge of the next (or current) SPI transfer.
When configured as a slave, SPI0 can be configured for 4-wire or 3-wire operation. The default, 4-wire slave mode, is active when NSSMD1 (SPI0CN.3) = 0 and NSSMD0 (SPI0CN.2) = 1. In 4-wire mode, the NSS signal is routed to a port pin and configured as a digital input. SPI0 is enabled when NSS is logic 0, and disabled when NSS is logic 1. The bit counter is reset on a falling edge of NSS. Note that the NSS signal must be driven low at least 2 system clocks before the first active edge of SCK for each byte transfer. Figure 24.4 shows a connection diagram between two slave devices in 4-wire slave mode and a master device.
3-wire slave mode is active when NSSMD1 (SPI0CN.3) = 0 and NSSMD0 (SPI0CN.2) = 0. NSS is not used in this mode, and is not mapped to an external port pin through the crossbar. Since there is no way of uniquely addressing the device in 3-wire slave mode, SPI0 must be the only slave device present on the bus. It is important to note that in 3-wire slave mode there is no external means of resetting the bit counter that determines when a full byte has been received. The bit counter can only be reset by disabling and re-enabling SPI0 with the SPIEN bit. Figure 24.3 shows a connection diagram between a slave device in 3-wire slave mode and a master device.
24.4. 	 SPI0 Interrupt Sources
When SPI0 interrupts are enabled, the following four flags will generate an interrupt when they are set to logic 1:
All of the following bits must be cleared by software.
1.	The SPI Interrupt Flag, SPIF (SPI0CN.7) is set to logic 1 at the end of each byte transfer. This flag can occur in all SPI0 modes.
2.	The Write Collision Flag, WCOL (SPI0CN.6) is set to logic 1 if a write to SPI0DAT is attempted when the transmit buffer has not been emptied to the SPI shift register. When this occurs, the write to SPI0DAT will be ignored, and the transmit buffer will not be written.This flag can occur in all SPI0 modes.
3.	The Mode Fault Flag MODF (SPI0CN.5) is set to logic 1 when SPI0 is configured as a master, and for multi-master mode and the NSS pin is pulled low. When a Mode Fault occurs, the MSTEN and SPIEN bits in SPI0CN are set to logic 0 to disable SPI0 and allow another master device to access the bus.
4.	The Receive Overrun Flag RXOVRN (SPI0CN.4) is set to logic 1 when configured as a slave, and a transfer is completed and the receive buffer still holds an unread byte from a previous transfer. The new byte is not transferred to the receive buffer, allowing the previously received data byte to be read. The data byte which caused the overrun is lost.
24.5. 	 Serial Clock Phase and Polarity
Four combinations of serial clock phase and polarity can be selected using the clock control bits in the SPI0 Configuration Register (SPI0CFG). The CKPHA bit (SPI0CFG.5) selects one of two clock phases (edge used to latch the data). The CKPOL bit (SPI0CFG.4) selects between an active-high or active-low clock. Both master and slave devices must be configured to use the same clock phase and polarity. SPI0 should be disabled (by clearing the SPIEN bit, SPI0CN.0) when changing the clock phase or polarity. The clock and data line relationships for master mode are shown in Figure 24.5. For slave mode, the clock and data relationships are shown in Figure 24.6 and Figure 24.7. CKPHA must be set to 0 on both the master and slave SPI when communicating between two of the following devices: C8051F04x, C8051F06x, C8051F12x, C8051F31x, C8051F32x, and C8051F33x.
The SPI0 Clock Rate Register (SPI0CKR) as shown in SFR Definition 24.3 controls the master mode serial clock frequency. This register is ignored when operating in slave mode. When the SPI is configured as a master, the maximum data transfer rate (bits/sec) is one-half the system clock frequency or 12.5 MHz, whichever is slower. When the SPI is configured as a slave, the maximum data transfer rate (bits/sec) for full-duplex operation is 1/10 the system clock frequency, provided that the master issues SCK, NSS (in 4-wire slave mode), and the serial input data synchronously with the slave’s system clock. If the master issues SCK, NSS, and the serial input data asynchronously, the maximum data transfer rate (bits/sec) must be less than 1/10 the system clock frequency. In the special case where the master only wants to transmit data to the slave and does not need to receive data from the slave (i.e. half-duplex operation), the SPI slave can receive data at a maximum data transfer rate (bits/sec) of 1/4 the system clock frequency. This is provided that the master issues SCK, NSS, and the serial input data synchronously with the slave’s system clock.

24.6. 	 SPI Special Function Registers
SPI0 is accessed and controlled through four special function registers in the system controller: SPI0CN Control Register, SPI0DAT Data Register, SPI0CFG Configuration Register, and SPI0CKR Clock Rate Register. The four special function registers related to the operation of the SPI0 Bus are described in the following figures.

4	CKPOL	SPI0 Clock Polarity. 
0: SCK line low in idle state.
1: SCK line high in idle state.		
3	SLVSEL	Slave Selected Flag. 
This bit is set to logic 1 whenever the NSS pin is low indicating SPI0 is the selected slave. It is cleared to logic 0 when NSS is high (slave not selected). This bit does not indicate the instantaneous value at the NSS pin, but rather a de-glitched version of the pin input.		
2	NSSIN	NSS Instantaneous Pin Input. 
This bit mimics the instantaneous value that is present on the NSS port pin at the time that the register is read. This input is not de-glitched.		
1	SRMT	Shift Register Empty (valid in slave mode only).
This bit will be set to logic 1 when all data has been transferred in/out of the shift register, and there is no new information available to read from the transmit buffer or write to the receive buffer. It returns to logic 0 when a data byte is transferred to the shift register from the transmit buffer or by a transition on SCK. SRMT = 1 when in Master Mode.		
0	RXBMT	Receive Buffer Empty (valid in slave mode only).
This bit will be set to logic 1 when the receive buffer has been read and contains no new information. If there is new information available in the receive buffer that has not been read, this bit will return to logic 0. RXBMT = 1 when in Master Mode.		
Note:	In slave mode, data on MOSI is sampled in the center of each data bit. In master mode, data on MISO is sampled one SYSCLK before the end of each data bit, to provide maximum settling time for the slave device. See Table 24.1 for timing parameters.

7	SPIF	SPI0 Interrupt Flag.
This bit is set to logic 1 by hardware at the end of a data transfer. If interrupts are enabled, setting this bit causes the CPU to vector to the SPI0 interrupt service routine. This bit is not automatically cleared by hardware. It must be cleared by software.		
6	WCOL	Write Collision Flag.

5	MODF	Mode Fault Flag.
This bit is set to logic 1 by hardware (and generates a SPI0 interrupt) when a master mode collision is detected (NSS is low, MSTEN = 1, and NSSMD[1:0] = 01). This bit is not automatically cleared by hardware. It must be cleared by software.		
4	RXOVRN	Receive Overrun Flag (valid in slave mode only).

This bit is not automatically cleared by hardware. It must be cleared by software.		
3:2	NSSMD[1:0]	Slave Select Mode.
Selects between the following NSS operation modes: 
(See Section 24.2 and Section 24.3).
00: 3-Wire Slave or 3-Wire Master Mode. NSS signal is not routed to a port pin.
01: 4-Wire Slave or Multi-Master Mode (Default). NSS is an input to the device.
1x: 4-Wire Single-Master Mode. NSS signal is mapped as an output from the device and will assume the value of NSSMD0.		
1	TXBMT	Transmit Buffer Empty.
This bit will be set to logic 0 when new data has been written to the transmit buffer. When data in the transmit buffer is transferred to the SPI shift register, this bit will be set to logic 1, indicating that it is safe to write a new byte to the transmit buffer.		
0	SPIEN	SPI0 Enable. 
0: SPI disabled.
1: SPI enabled.
